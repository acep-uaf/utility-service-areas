    "text": "This site allows users to view and download the authorized service areas of utilities certificated by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA). The RCA sets and approves the areas in which utilities may operate, and provides this information on a per-utility basis through their website. These boundaries are invaluable for researchers who are studying energy rates in communities across Alaska, especially since the majority of Alaskans are served by microgrid systems which are not interconnected to a broader traditional power grid.\nThe goal of this project was to create a single geospatial file in GeoJSON format which contains the service area boundaries of every active electric utility in Alaska. No such file currently exists."
