    "text": "This site allows users to view and download the authorized service areas of utilities certificated by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA). The RCA sets and approves the areas in which utilities may operate, and provides this information on a per-utility basis through their website. These boundaries are invaluable for researchers who are studying energy rates in communities across Alaska, especially since the majority of Alaskans are served by microgrid systems which are not interconnected to a broader traditional power grid.\nThe goal of this project is to create a single geospatial layer containing the service area boundaries of every active electric utility in Alaska.\n\nThe State of Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs (DCRA) also provides service area layers for electric, water, sewer, and natural gas utilities certificated by the RCA. For more information, visit the DCRA open data portal at https://dcra-cdo-dcced.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=rca\n\nNote: before using this data in your project, please read this entire page to learn more about how this dataset was assembled. Because of source data quality issues, this dataset does not contain every utility’s service area, and if it does, it might not be up-to-date."

    "text": "How the pipeline works\nThis repository uses a data pipeline written using the targets R package. The pipeline consists of the following components:\n\nA list of active electric certificates is retrieved from the RCA website. For each certificate, the provided service area KML file is downloaded.\n\nNote: not all electric certificates on the RCA website have service area KML files available for download, which poses issues.\n\nCertificates that do not have service areas or do not serve consumers - such as wholesale or independent power producers - are filtered out. Identified errors in the source data, such as inactive utilities still marked as active, are also removed. (see Manual Patches below).\nAdditional data quality issues are manually corrected (see Manual Patches below).\nThe service areas are combined into a single layer and exported to GeoJSON format with appropriate metadata.\n\nAs mentioned above, not all electric certificates on the RCA website have service area KML files available for download. Additionally, some of the KML files that were available for download were out of date or did not accurately reflect the service area description. Unfortunately, there is no automated, one-size-fits-all solution for a dataset like this, but when possible, data issues were fixed (“patched”) on a case-by-case basis and the fixes integrated into the data pipeline."

    "text": "Other fixes\nWhen a utility’s service area was missing (because there was no KML available on the RCA site) or incorrect, corrected service areas were created by hardcoding the correct Public Land Survey System (PLSS) descriptions when possible. Using the Alaska Department of Natural Resources’ PLSS sections dataset, the script then retrieved the appropriate polygons for those descriptions.\nThe table below lists utilities whose service areas were manually corrected using this method, along with the reason for the correction and a link to the related issue or pull request.\n\n\n\nCertificate\nIssue\nReference\n\n\n\n\nCity of Akiak\nTypo in certificate service area description\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/issues/11\n\n\nAkiachak\nTypo in certificate service area description\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/issues/12\n\n\nChefornak\nTypo in certificate service area description\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/issues/16\n\n\nPuvurnaq Power Company\nTypo in certificate service area description\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/issues/47\n\n\nUnalakleet Valley Electric Cooperative\nNo KML available from RCA site\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/pull/45\n\n\nBirch Creek Tribal Council\nNo KML available from RCA site\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/pull/46\n\n\n\nSome of the service area KML files available on the RCA website are outdated, since RCA no longer maintains them. This creates issues when a utility expands its service area by acquiring another utility. In these cases, the acquiring utility’s service area should include both its original territory and the territory of the acquired utility.\nThis problem is especially relevant for the Alaska Village Electric Cooperative (AVEC), which has acquired numerous small utilities over the last decade and now serves 59 discontinuous communities across Alaska. Although AVEC’s official KML does not reflect many of these acquisitions, the acquired utilities’ KML files are still available. By merging those KMLs into AVEC’s service area, the script reconstructs a more accurate representation of AVEC’s current service area.\nThe table below lists utilities that were manually merged into acquiring utilities for this reason.\n\n\n\nAcquiring utility\nAcquired utility\nReference\n\n\n\n\nAVEC\nTeller Power Company\nhttps://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/ViewFile.aspx?id=6e731ed9-5898-4eaa-814c-8d1547ddac1a\n\n\nAVEC\nCity of Kotlik\nhttps://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/ViewFile.aspx?id=598DFC13-86CF-47A0-A1A3-09245D482BA9\n\n\nAVEC\nCity of Ekwok\nhttps://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/ViewFile.aspx?id=8c915917-efe4-41ca-8d7d-1cb7534b19a9\n\n\nAVEC\nCity of Kobuk\nhttps://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/ViewFile.aspx?id=2f3dee1f-e202-434b-8f0a-714714ca3682\n\n\nAVEC\nBethel Utilities Corporation\nhttps://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/ViewFile.aspx?id=6eeb6425-ce1f-4c2f-b765-dfd3505e299f\n\n\nAVEC\nTwin Hills\nhttps://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/ViewFile.aspx?id=677d0f01-25b2-4c01-bf9b-bea7358300f9\n\n\nCEA\nML&P\nhttps://github.com/acep-uaf/utility-service-areas/issues/9#issuecomment-3054393380"
